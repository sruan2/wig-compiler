To run the compiler:

First 'make' the executable main.native

Then you may view all possible actions by running "./main.native -help"

Here is a breakdown:

You must always specify a file using "-f <file>" where <file> is the path to a WiG program

-v will make some operations more verbose (in progress)
-p will pretty-print the abstract syntax tree
-w will weed out bad programs
-s will print a symbol table of the program
-t will typecheck the program
-c will compile the program and generate a CGI file

'make' will automatically perform a bunch of tests, but you can use these commands:
'make code' to only compile
'make check' to run all tests
'make <test>' to run a specific test (pretty,weed,symbol...)
